# Polars Youtube

This is the accompanying material for my Youtube video outlining the four reasons I switched from Pandas to Polars.

The material can be found in the Polar.ipynb and Pandas.ipynb notebooks. 

For the "big" dataset, run the python script generate_test.py. Feel free to change the rows variable to either smaller or larger as you see fit. This script can take awhile to run as it is not optimized in any manner. The output file can also take up quite a bit of memory on your disk. User beware...
